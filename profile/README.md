## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This org contains (or will contain) the definition of the spec for the Web Activity Pub (WebAP) API and related tooling.

The WebAP API is a proposal for a Web API that exposes Activity Pub Client (as in Client to Server, C2S) capabilities to websites through the browser.

The main use case driving this API is the cross interactions between Activity Pub supporting service instances at front end level.

You can find the original proposal at [Proposal: The browser as a client with a new web standard- cross- instance interactions on the web](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/proposal-the-browser-as-a-client-with-a-new-web-standard-cross-instance-interactions-on-the-web/2806/12) (socialhub.activitypub.rocks).
